      <p>If you haven’t noticed, banking in Texas and around the nation has changed. In the span of a few years, we have watched banks go from one location to literally thousands. In addition, we have seen how decisions made by banks based a thousand miles away effect not only how their local branches are run, but how their questionable lending practices have literally strained our national economy. At </p>
      <h2>All banks are not created equal.</h2>
      <p>From our bank’s beginning in 2003, we have remained a one-location bank -- by choice. But just because we don’t have multiple locations doesn’t mean we can’t provide the very best in banking products and services. In fact, we think our size when combined with our values and philosophy gives us some distinct advantages over larger banks that are not based here.</p>
      <p>TrinityBank was created from scratch for our local Tarrant County customers. We’re an independent bank with a local board of directors and an experienced professional staff. That means we can move fast because we make all the decisions here. And by limiting our brick and mortar to one central location and providing first-class Internet Banking, we’re able to keep our overhead to a minimum so our customer service and product quality can be at a maximum.</p>
      <p>So look around our website, or better yet, come by and look around our bank. We think you will discover what so many of our customers tell us, we’re a bank that’s BIG enough to handle their business, but SMALL enough to know our customers names -- and needs.  Maybe TrinityBank is &quot;<strong><em>The One and Only&quot;</em></strong> bank for you. We hope so.<br />

      <p>Sincerely,<br />
